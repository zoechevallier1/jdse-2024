Title: Deep Learning in protein-protein interactions <br>
Abstract : Most proteins perform their biological functions by interacting with other molecules or themselves.
Identifying protein-protein interactions (PPI) therefore provides biological information on protein functions, disease prevalence and the development of therapies.
However, finding the interacting protein pairs using experimental approaches is time-consuming and labor-intensive due to the diversity of proteins.
Deep Learning methods have enabled major advances in predicting the three-dimensional structure of proteins from genomes, predicting the functions and attributes of a protein and in modifying and designing new task-specific proteins.
During this talk, various methods and recent breakthroughs in Deep Learning enabling unprecedented results in reconstructing protein-protein interactions networks and estimating changes in binding affinity will be presented. <br/>
Biography: A. Carbone is Professor of Computer Science at Sorbonne University, 
Director of the Laboratory of Computational and Quantitative Biology (LCQB) and co-director of the Bioinformatics and Modeling (BIM) Master's program. 
She develops deep learning methods, mathematical models based on statistics and combinatorics, and algorithmic approaches to study the fundamental principles of cellular functioning from genomic data. 
Its projects aim to understand the principles of evolution and co-evolution of molecular structures. It concerns genome evolution, ancient genomes and adaptation, protein-protein interactions and their evolution.
